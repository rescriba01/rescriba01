I'm looking to collaborate on anything that needs work done. Currently I am looking through the following tags on projects:
* first-contributors
* community-projects
* :gift: Beginner
* contribution welcome
* contribution-starter
* help-wanted
as well as all the other usual suspects.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Software development prokects where i can use JavaScript, React, and or Python to bolster those skillsets.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with alll the aforementioned languages.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Beer, Comics (they, like my children, are all unique and because of this I love them all), Coffee (and brewing methods), Gaming.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vanilla JavaScript and React to level up my developement skills. My focus of late has been on customizing WordPress sites and I also have been continuously developing my Python abilities. I have grown fond of Python and will continue to sharpen these skills whenever and wherever possible. Ideally I'd like ot use React as the frontend and Python on the backend and [this]() page of mine is that focus. I enjoy editing documentation and reviewing code. The best way to sum up my current mindset this quote:

>   Be observing constantly. Stay open minded. Be eager to learn and improve.
