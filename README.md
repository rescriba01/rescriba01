I'm looking to collaborate on anything that needs work done. Currently I am looking through the following tags on projects:
* first-contributors
* community-projects
* :gift: Beginner
* contribution welcome
* contribution-starter
* help-wanted
as well as all the other usual suspects.

🌱 I’m currently learning software developement and focusing on React.js a a frontend framework and I have grown fond of Python and will continue to sharpen these skills whnever and whereever possible. I enjoy editing documentation and reviewing code. The best way to sum up my current mindset this quote:
